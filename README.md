# ExpenseTracker
IOS app built with Swift and SwiftUI which helps you to track your expenses over time.

It has a set of dummy data fetched with Combine from https://designcode.io/data/transactions.json 
and it shows a chart with a line that represents the expenses and a list of all the transactions groupped by month 

I have also implemented some packages from other repos: 
SwiftUICharts: https://github.com/AppPear/ChartView
SwiftUIFontIcon: https://github.com/huybuidac/SwiftUIFontIcon
